SPUR – MindMesh Live Chat (AI-Powered Customer Support System)

Developed a full-stack AI-powered real-time chat system using React, Node.js, TypeScript, MySQL, and Redis, focused on low-latency and scalable customer support.

Integrated OpenAI LLM with session-based conversation management, persisting chat history via UUIDs and maintaining contextual accuracy across reloads.

Implemented Redis caching with TTL to minimize repeated LLM calls, improving response time and reducing API costs.

Designed a clean, layered backend architecture with robust validation, graceful error handling, and production-ready security practices.
